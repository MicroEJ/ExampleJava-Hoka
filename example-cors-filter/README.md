# Overview

The example [CORSFilterServer](src/main/java/com/microej/example/hoka/WebServer.java) shows a basic instantiation of `HttpServer` with CORS Filter.

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.
The CORS standard describes new HTTP headers that give browsers and servers a way to request a remote URL only if they have permission to do so. Although some validations and permissions may be performed by the server, it is generally the browserâ€™s responsibility to support these headers and to honor the restrictions they impose.

# Usage

## Run on MicroEJ Simulator

1. Right-click on the project
2. Select **Run as -> MicroEJ Application**
3. Select your platform 
4. Press **OK**
5. The URL being used is http://localhost:8080.
6. Send a GET request to /hello/:name from another server 2 (host 2) from a client app running in a browser.
7. Notice that the CORS request is accepted by the server even if it come from a different host.
8. Disable (comment) the CORS filter and retry. the request should be rejected.

## Run on device

### Build

1. Right Click on the project,
2. Select **Run as > Run Configuration**,
3. Select **MicroEJ Application** configuration kind,
4. Click on **New launch configuration** icon,
5. In **Execution** tab:
	1. In **Target** frame, in **Platform** field, select a platform,
	2. In **Execution** frame:
		1. Select **Execute on Device**,
		2. In **Settings** field, select **Build & Deploy**,
6. Press **Apply**,
7. Press **Run**,
8. The MicroEJ application files (`microejapp.o`, `microejruntime.a`, include files) have been generated.
9. Build the BSP project of the device.

### Flash

1. Use the appropriate flashing tool.
2. Check the INFO logs for the URL information (this is an example): "The IP address of the board is: /192.168.0.224"
3. Send a GET request to /hello/:name from another server 2 (host 2) from a client app running in a browser.
4. Notice that the CORS request is accepted by the server even if it come from a different host.
5. Disable (comment) the CORS filter and retry. the request should be rejected.
